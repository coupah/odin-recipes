    <h2>Mmm yummy slightly crunchy chorizo in pasta</h2>

    <p>This dish is straighforward and tasty af, but you have to watch how long you bake it</p>

    <ul>
        <li>one large onion or a number of salad/spring onions</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>a "rope" (?) of chorizo</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons of mascarpone</li>
        <li>a bit of smelly blue cheeze</li>
        <li>a few cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>a sweep pepper, any colour</li>
        <li>pepper, salt</li>
        <li>penne pasta for 4 persons</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Put on large pan of salted water to boil. Upon boiling, add penne for four persons. Set timer 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Slice onions, peel garic, put to one side together. In another container, put sliced chorizo, tomatoes, and peppers.</li>

        <li>When pasta is al dente, drain and return to the warm pan. Stir in 2 - 3 good tablespoons of mascarpone til it melts. Add the sliced onions and peeled garlic, salt, pepper. </li>

        <li>Heat oven to approx 180C. Add other ingredients (chorizo, tomato, smelly cheese) to the pasta.</li>

        <li>Put into ovenproof dish with lid. Bake for approx 30 mins, then remove lid for another 10-20 mins to colour.</li>

        <li>It's nice fresh, sprinkled with grated cheese, but actually I've found it's MUCH nicer reheated the next day (the flavours are more intense). I also divide into portions and freeze, making a tasty instant microwave meal.</li>
